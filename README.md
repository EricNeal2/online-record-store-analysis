# Online Record Store Analysis
In this project, I wrote SQL queries in order to answer a series business questions.

I used the [Chinook database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database), a sample database for an online digital media store, which includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices and customers.

Note: The `ipython-sql` module is required to run the SQL queries in the Jupyter Notebook `record_store_analysis.ipynb`

  - total number of customers?
  - total value of sales?
  - average value of sales per customer?
  - average order value?
- **Albums vs. Individual Tracks**: What percentage of purchases are individual tracks vs whole albums?
